# Iris Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the **Iris dataset**, a classic dataset in machine learning. The dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with four numerical features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and one categorical feature (species: setosa, versicolor, virginica). The goal of this EDA is to understand the dataset's structure, distributions, relationships, and patterns using Python with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Contents
- `Iris_EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the EDA code, visualizations, and insights.
- Visualizations include histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, pairplots, and a correlation heatmap.
- Key insights:
  - Distribution of features (e.g., petal length is multimodal).
  - Relationships between features (e.g., petal length and width are strongly correlated).
  - Differences across species (e.g., setosa has smaller petals).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3** with the following libraries:
  - `pandas`
